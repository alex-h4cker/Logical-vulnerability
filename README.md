# Logical-vulnerability
An article for logical vulnerabilities

Logical vulnerability in the web application means there is an error in the program logic that may cause some unauthorized operations to be performed, in other words, these types of vulnerabilities are produced due to the incorrectness of the program logic and how the data is interpreted.

For example, suppose you have an online shopping site that intends to offer special discounts to its users. If the program logic is not correct, such a site may incorrectly apply special discounts to all users, even non-affiliated users.

Logical vulnerability in web applications usually causes the misuse of server resources and the spread of unlimited space attacks. To avoid these types of vulnerabilities, the logic of the program should be implemented with high precision and accuracy and appropriate tests should be performed to verify its accuracy.

What does finding a logical vulnerability entail:

Finding logic flaws is beyond what any automated tool can do
Discovering logical vulnerability requires deep investigation and analysis of system and program. These types of vulnerabilities usually occur due to logical errors in the program code and are identified by careful analysis of the code and system processes. To discover logical vulnerabilities, methods of penetration testing, code analysis, system behavior analysis and the use of special tools such as Automated Code Review are used.

The difference between logical and technical vulnerabilities in web applications

1. Technical vulnerabilities:
These types of vulnerabilities are related to technical errors in programming and programming frameworks. These errors may occur for various reasons, including incorrect syntax, incorrect logic, incorrect data, etc. Unlike logical vulnerabilities, these types of vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed, and WAFs prevent this vulnerability.

2. Logical vulnerabilities:
Logical vulnerabilities are related to the logic errors of the writing program, which may occur for various reasons, including algorithm inaccuracy, user logic inaccuracy, system logic inaccuracy, etc. These types of vulnerabilities are more difficult for programmers and may be difficult or even impossible to fix due to incorrect logic that WAFs are not capable of dealing with.

Common logical vulnerabilities :
Race conditions
broken Authentication attack
Broken access control
Security misconfiguration
Insufficient Cryptography
Insecure Communication

Race conditions:
A situation in which two or more processes simultaneously access shared resources and attempt to modify those resources. This situation may cause unintended errors, as undesirable results occur in concurrent processes. In simple terms, race condition is a situation in which two or more processes simultaneously try to apply changes to shared resources, and this causes undesirable errors in concurrent processes.

authentication attack:
It means attacking systems that use weak identification and authentication methods. In this type of attacks, hackers try to gain access to users' accounts by using various methods, such as trying to guess passwords or using automated software, and then use it to gain access to sensitive information To prevent this type of attacks, stronger and more complex methods for identification and authentication should be used.

Broken access control:
It means lack of authentication and control of users' access to system resources. In this case, users may have access to resources that they should not have or use them in an unlimited and unrestricted manner. This vulnerability may cause the abuse of system resources by hackers and brings serious risks to organizations

Security Misconfiguration:
It must be defined and implemented for the application, framework, application server, web server, database server, and platform. If these are not configured correctly, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or capabilities

Insufficient Cryptography:
It means the use of weak or insufficient encryption algorithms in security systems, which causes sensitive and confidential information such as passwords, bank information, etc. to disappear. This type of vulnerability makes it easy for hackers to access sensitive information and use it illegally.

Insecure Communication:
Vulnerability of insecure communication means there is a defect in the communication methods between two different devices or services, which makes sensitive and important information accessible to hackers and other illegal people during transmission. In other words, if insecure methods are used to transfer data, malicious people may easily access it and change it or even abuse it.
